* My dotfiles

You have stumbled upon yet another repository containing a bunch of dotfiles.

** Installation

To install my dotfiles, run this script in the top-level directory of this
repository:

#+begin_src shell
./install.sh
#+end_src

This creates a symbolic link for each configuration file at the proper place on
the filesystem.
